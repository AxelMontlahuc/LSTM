# Project
This is an implementation of a LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) from scratch, no libraries in pure C. 
It is trained on weather data of the city of New Dehli, India and predicts the temperature. 

# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to deeply understand how LSTMs work as I will be using them in a future project. 
Having a working implementation will therefore help. 

# Usage
To compile the code, run:
```bash
gcc -o lstm main.c -lm
```
